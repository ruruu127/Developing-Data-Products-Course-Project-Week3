# Overview
This markdown document is created as part of the Week 3 course project on Courseraâ€™s Developing Data Products. This will implement the use of the R package plotly to display a plot of popular books on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) based on average user ratings and genre.

# Popular Books on Goodreads Based on Average User Ratings and Genre

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

df <- read.csv("books.csv")
df$genre <- as.factor(df$genre)

# Plot ratings against genre
a <- ggplot(df, aes(title, rating, 
               col = genre)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = genre), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Ratings of each book", x = "Books", y = "Ratings",
       subtitle = "Which genre has the book with the highest rating?",
       col = "Genre", size = "Genre")

ggplotly(a)
```
